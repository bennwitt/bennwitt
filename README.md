## 🧱 My Foundation: Ops, Infra, and the Tech Backbone

Before I ever wrote a line of AI-powered anything, I was **hands-on with the guts of technology** — running global systems, scaling services, fixing fires in real-time.

I’ve lived the "All Hands On" life. Whether leading a team or solo firefighting, I handled:

- 🏗️ Self-hosted systems, cloud environments, and 3rd-party data centers  
- ☁️ Cloud infra (Azure, AWS), hybrid rollouts  
- 💾 Enterprise storage (SAN, NAS)  
- 🧮 SQL / NoSQL / Document DBs  
- 📞 Telephony, VoIP, LAN/WAN, Routing, Switching  
- 🛠️ Everything needed to **run a services-focused IT business**  
- 🎯 Ops excellence, availability, performance, scale

That full-stack operational DNA still powers everything I build in AI today.

## 🚨 Sonic Foundry – Mission-Critical Engineering on the Edge

At Sonic Foundry, I was the “Save-the-Day” engineer — no exaggeration. I owned **Customer Success + Escalation Engineering** for a global-scale video platform (Mediasite), supporting:

- 🎥 Live & on-demand event streaming (self-hosted & SaaS)  
- 🌐 Global distribution (China, EU, Middle East, etc.)  
- ⚙️ CDN optimization, geo-load balancing, last-mile delivery  
- 🧠 SQL-heavy backend tuning  
- 🔐 Browser standard weirdness, LMS/auth integrations, SDKs  
- 🖥️ Hardware/software encoding, accessibility and compliance

Think high-stakes video infrastructure where **failure wasn’t an option**. I became a human debugger, architect, diplomat, and platform therapist.

- 🧪 Study guides (auto & user-curated), flashcards, quizzes  
- 🎞️ Short clip & thumbnail generation  
- 🧠 Metadata extraction, recommendation systems, insight generation  
- 📈 Engagement & presentation analytics, pattern detection  

💻 **Under the hood:**  
- Python 🐍  
- Self-hosted OSS models 🔓  
- OpenAI, NVIDIA stack, AWS + Azure ☁️  
- Built from scratch: ideation → POC → pilot → GA  
- I owned it end-to-end. Not just code — the entire lifecycle.

## 🧠 The TL;DR of Me

I’m a **pragmatic idealist** — the kind who’ll question everything, but also ship the damn thing. I don’t dream of PM frameworks — I build tools that **work**, with AI pipelines under the hood and empathy in the UX.

I speak executive and engineer. I scale from zero to "holy sh*t, that works" — and I love crossing that bridge fast.

If you're a mission-driven org, a skunkworks innovation team, or someone trying to get AI out of the hype zone and into actual lives — let's talk.
