## 🎤 The Pitch
I’m Benn, an AI Engineer and pragmatic builder who designs **AI systems that amplify people rather than replace them.**  
Think of me as the **translator between AI capabilities and real-world operations** — turning complexity into clarity, chaos into context, and experiments into production-grade systems.

> 🧘 “I don’t replace the operator — I give them the Iron Man suit.”

---

## 🩹 The Problem
Modern operations — whether in manufacturing, logistics, or creative work — are drowning in:  
- **Unstructured data** (scanned records, instrument logs, compliance docs)  
- **Manual workflows** that slow throughput  
- **Context overload** where critical signals get buried in noise  
- **Regulatory & quality burdens** that demand precision, traceability, and auditability  

Teams need AI that doesn’t just “do magic,” but **slots seamlessly into existing processes, improves efficiency, and stays compliant.**

---

## 💡 The Solution
I build **AI solutions that empower humans** by:  
- **OCR + Document AI** → Transforming scanned records into structured, compliant datasets (21 CFR Part 11 ready).  
- **Predictive Modeling** → Surfacing process drift from LC/MS, chromatography, and instrument logs before failures happen.  
- **RAG & Semantic Search** → Turning messy knowledge bases into intelligent, queryable systems.  
- **Multimodal AI Analyzers** → Linking text, image, and layout features to measurable performance outcomes.  
- **Operational Pipelines** → Embedding AI directly into existing stacks (SAP, ELN/LIMS, IIoT, Azure).

## 📈 Traction & Proof
I’ve delivered real systems that show measurable value:  

| 🚧 Project | 🛠️ What It Does |  
|------------|-----------------|  
| 🔊 **AI-Insight Video Processor** | Converts video → transcript, quiz, captions, and insights with Whisper + CUDA + FFmpeg |  
| 🧠 **RAG + ArangoDB Stack** | Embedding-aware semantic search for high-relevance knowledge retrieval |  
| 🧬 **Manufacturing Ops AI Tools** | OCR → classification → audit logs → insights for regulatory compliance |  
| 🎨 **Multimodal Campaign Analyzer** | Correlates creative asset design with donor behavior & outcomes |  
| 🤖 **Agentic AI Personas** | Dynamic prompt-tuned “AI teammates” with hyperparameter personality knobs |  
| 🧪 **MUSE** | Evaluates creative assets across composition, tone, and performance impact |  
| 🎥 **SCENE** | Multimodal video intelligence → segmentation, summaries, story arcs |  

Each project shares one DNA: **designed to be understood, used, and trusted in real workflows.**

## 📊 Impact & ROI
- **Reduced Cycle Time** → Automating data prep & audits = faster throughput.  
- **Improved Compliance** → Structured, labeled, auditable datasets for regulated environments.  
- **Enhanced Decision-Making** → AI surfaces the signal, humans keep control.  
- **Operational Fit** → Every solution built to slot into existing stacks (Databricks, Azure, Power BI, ArangoDB, etc.).  

I don’t build “lab experiments.” I build **Iron Man suits for operators.**

## 👥 The Team (That’s Me + You)
- **My Role**: AI Engineer / Data Scientist → bridging math, code, and messy real-world systems.  
- **Your Role**: Domain experts (scientists, planners, builders, ops).  
- **Together**: We accelerate adoption, coach teams, and move from Excel hacks → production AI pipelines.  

---

## 🎯 The Ask
If you’re looking for someone who can:  
- Discover **high-impact AI use cases** by shadowing workflows  
- Design, test, and **operationalize models in regulated environments**  
- Coach teams on adoption, usage, and long-term ownership  
- Deliver **measurable outcomes** (not just prototypes)…  

👉 Then I’m your investment.

## 🧰 My Stack
Python • FastAPI • ArangoDB • OpenAI • W&B • Docker • CUDA • FFmpeg • Azure • PyTorch • NVIDIA • Custom RAG • OCR Pipelines  

---

## 🧘 Final Word
AI isn’t magic.  
It’s **math + context — and context is always human.**

We’re not here to replace people.  
We’re here to **remove chaos, reveal signal, and bring our best work to the surface.**
