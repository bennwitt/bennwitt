## 🎤 The Pitch
I am Benn — a **solutions engineer and pragmatic idealist** with a career spanning **IT service delivery, enterprise operations, and AI engineering.**  
My foundation was built in escalation engineering for hardware, software, SaaS, and PaaS, where I developed a discipline for designing resilient, accountable systems that kept global services running.  

In the past five years, I have extended this foundation with **AI-driven solutions** — using machine learning and automation to reduce inefficiency, improve clarity, and scale services and delivery.  

I specialize in translating between **AI capability and operational need**, delivering solutions that align with real-world constraints while creating measurable business value.

## 🩹 The Problem
Modern operations — whether in manufacturing, logistics, or creative workflows — face:  
- **Data overload**: scanned records, instrument logs, and compliance docs that resist easy analysis.  
- **Inefficiency**: manual workflows that slow throughput and introduce risk.  
- **High stakes**: regulated environments where errors mean cost, delay, or compliance risk.  

Teams need more than dashboards — they need **AI that integrates into their systems, augments their decisions, and scales with their reality.**

## 👥 The Team (That’s Me + You)
- **My Role**: Engineer + operator → building tools that scale and survive in production.  
- **Your Role**: Domain experts who know the business pain points.  
- **Together**: We accelerate adoption, cut inefficiency, and transform experiments into enterprise-ready AI.

## 🧘 Final Word
AI isn’t magic.  
It’s **math + context — and context is always human.**

I don’t build hype.  
I build **Iron Man suits for operators.**
