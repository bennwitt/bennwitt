## 🎤 The Pitch
I am Benn — a **solutions engineer and pragmatic idealist** with a career spanning **IT service delivery, enterprise operations, and AI engineering.**  
My foundation was built in escalation engineering for hardware, software, SaaS, and PaaS, where I developed a discipline for designing resilient, accountable systems that kept global services running.  

In the past five years, I have extended this foundation with **AI-driven solutions** — using machine learning and automation to reduce inefficiency, improve clarity, and scale services and delivery.  

I specialize in translating between **AI capability and operational need**, delivering solutions that align with real-world constraints while creating measurable business value.

## 🩹 The Problem
Across industries — marketing and advertising, manufacturing, logistics, IT operations, service delivery, creative production, and events managment — organizations face a consistent set of challenges:  

- **Volume and complexity of data**: telemetry, logs, and documents that are difficult to parse into insight.  
- **Operational inefficiency**: manual workflows, redundant processes, and siloed systems that limit throughput.  
- **High-stakes visibility**: regulated production lines, client-facing platforms, and live event broadcasts where transparency and precision are non-negotiable.  
- **Skills gap in emerging technologies**: teams benefit from upskilling in AI, machine learning, and pattern recognition, but practical adoption remains slow.  

The problem is not a lack of tools or dashboards. It is the **translation gap** between overwhelming data streams and the clarity required for resilient, transparent, and trusted decision-making.

## 💡 The Solution  

I build **human-centered AI systems** that blend my service delivery and operations background with modern AI.  
My focus is not on hype, but on **practical tools** that integrate seamlessly into real workflows:  

- 📄 **Document & Language Intelligence**  
   - **OCR & Parsing** → Transform scanned docs, creative copy, and campaign assets into structured datasets.  
   - **Compliance-Ready** → Designed for traceability and auditability (21 CFR Part 11 mindset).  
   - **MUSE + CopyThat** → Analyze tone, style, and effectiveness, generating insights and iterations for operators and creatives.  
   - **Context Preservation** → Maintains structure and metadata for accurate retrieval and reuse.  

- 📊 **Predictive Monitoring**  
   - **HOLA (Holistic Log Analyzer)** → Centralizes telemetry, logs, and metrics using ELK for drift detection and anomaly surfacing.  
   - **MMS (Monitoring & Metrics Service)** → Tracks encoders, servers, and worker farm queues to ensure uptime in high-visibility, client-facing environments.  
   - **Ops Discipline** → Designed with escalation workflows in mind — proactive instead of reactive.  
   - **Resilient by Design** → Patterns and anomalies surfaced early to prevent outages and failures.  

- 🧠 **Operational RAG**  
   - **Semantic Search** → Embedding-aware retrieval across sprawling, enterprise-scale knowledge bases.  
   - **Context Injection** → Enhances workflows and decision-making with just-in-time relevant knowledge.  
   - **ArangoDB Stack** → Vector search + graph connections to capture relationships between concepts, not just keywords.  
   - **Scales with Ops** → Built to run alongside enterprise platforms (SAP, ELN/LIMS, Azure).  

- 🎨 **Multimodal Analyzers**  
   - **Image + Text + Layout** → Correlates design features with performance and audience behavior.  
   - **Campaign Intelligence** → Evaluates creative assets based on tone, composition, and impact.  
   - **Cross-Domain Fit** → Equally applicable to creative ops, scientific publishing, or operational documents.  
   - **Pattern Recognition** → Surfaces signals humans might miss, while leaving interpretation to the operator.  

- 🎥 **Video Intelligence**  
   - **Segment & Structure** → Breaks down long-form content into chapters, summaries, and story arcs.  
   - **Searchable by Anything** → Query videography by **shot types, emotions, tone, metaphors, concepts, and ideas**.  
   - **Entity & Sentiment Aware** → Uses **NER + sentiment analysis** to tag who, what, when, where, and why.  
   - **Semantic Understanding** → Surfaces context, emotion, and narrative flow — not just words.  
   - **Conversational Access** → Interactive natural language search engine that lets anyone **ask and find anything in any frame, image, or video.**  

👉 In short: I design AI to **fit into enterprise contexts**, not fight against them — running alongside existing systems, workflows, and human judgment.
