> Turning AI from capability into value — with tools, clarity, and human-centered strategy.

## 👋 Hi, I’m Benn 
A pragmatic idealist with a track record of making AI systems usable, impactful, and adopted across real-world teams.

I specialize in helping organizations unlock the value of AI by building tailored tools, aligning product with business needs, and ensuring the humans in the loop are supported every step of the way — from enablement content to post-launch success plans.

## 🧠 What I Bring to Ai Support Roles

- ✅ **Proven AI Product Experience**  
  I’ve shipped AI-driven products that transcribe, summarize, generate, classify, recommend, and advise — all with metrics tied to business outcomes.

- ✅ **Customer-Facing Depth**  
  From mission-critical live-streaming at Sonic Foundry to working directly with stakeholders at Moore, I’ve built trust and delivered value under pressure.

- ✅ **Cross-Functional Communication**  
  I operate fluidly across executive, product, and engineering levels. I speak “AI” and translate it into value for stakeholders at any altitude.

- ✅ **Adoption + Success Mindset**  
  Tools I build don’t just work — they get adopted. Because I document, educate, support, and stay present through every phase: POC → Pilot → GA → Scale.

- ✅ **Enablement + Evangelism**  
  I create guides, demo videos, and teachback assets to make sure what’s built is understood and used — not just shipped.
