## 🎤 The Pitch
I’m Benn — a **pragmatic idealist** and **solutions engineer** with roots in **IT service delivery and operations**.  
I cut my teeth keeping enterprise platforms running — as an **escalation engineer** for hardware, software, SaaS, and PaaS — where uptime, customer trust, and clear communication mattered more than buzzwords.  

Now I bring that same discipline into **AI engineering**.  
Over the past five years, I’ve focused on using AI *where it truly fits*: to cut through complexity, surface clarity, and extend human capability.  

Think of me as the **translator between AI potential and operational reality** — turning frontline pain points into production-ready systems that people can actually use and trust.

## 🩹 The Problem
Modern operations — whether in manufacturing, logistics, or creative workflows — face:  
- **Data overload**: scanned records, instrument logs, and compliance docs that resist easy analysis.  
- **Inefficiency**: manual workflows that slow throughput and introduce risk.  
- **High stakes**: regulated environments where errors mean cost, delay, or compliance risk.  

Teams need more than dashboards — they need **AI that integrates into their systems, augments their decisions, and scales with their reality.**

## 👥 The Team (That’s Me + You)
- **My Role**: Engineer + operator → building tools that scale and survive in production.  
- **Your Role**: Domain experts who know the business pain points.  
- **Together**: We accelerate adoption, cut inefficiency, and transform experiments into enterprise-ready AI.

## 🧘 Final Word
AI isn’t magic.  
It’s **math + context — and context is always human.**

I don’t build hype.  
I build **Iron Man suits for operators.**
