## 🎤 The Pitch
I’m Benn, an **AI Engineer and pragmatic builder** who designs **AI systems that amplify people rather than replace them.**  

Think of me as the **translator between AI capabilities and real-world operations** — turning complexity into clarity, chaos into context, and experiments into production-grade systems.  

But before I was building custom RAG stacks and multimodal analyzers, I spent years in **IT operations and service delivery**, running enterprise platforms where uptime, stability, and scalability weren’t optional — they were the mission. That background means I design AI with the same mindset: **resilient, accountable, and ready for production.**

> 🧘 “I don’t replace the operator — I give them the Iron Man suit.”

## 🩹 The Problem
Modern operations — whether in manufacturing, logistics, or creative workflows — face:  
- **Data overload**: scanned records, instrument logs, and compliance docs that resist easy analysis.  
- **Inefficiency**: manual workflows that slow throughput and introduce risk.  
- **High stakes**: regulated environments where errors mean cost, delay, or compliance risk.  

Teams need more than dashboards — they need **AI that integrates into their systems, augments their decisions, and scales with their reality.**

## 💡 The Solution
I build **human-centered AI systems** that combine my ops background with modern AI:  

- **OCR + Document AI** → Converting messy scanned data into structured, compliant, 21 CFR Part 11–ready datasets.  
- **Predictive Modeling** → Detecting process drift in LC/MS, chromatography, and instrument logs before failures happen.  
- **Operational RAG** → Embedding-aware semantic search to tame sprawling knowledge bases.  
- **Multimodal Analyzers** → Linking image + text + layout to real outcomes (creative, scientific, operational).  
- **AI in Enterprise Contexts** → Designing pipelines that run alongside **SAP, ELN/LIMS, IIoT, Azure, and enterprise stacks** without breaking ops.

## 📈 Traction & Proof
My work spans both **enterprise IT ops** and **AI innovation**:

| 🚧 Project | 🛠️ What It Does |  
|------------|-----------------|  
| 🔧 **Enterprise Ops Systems** | Diagnostic & monitoring platforms → reduced resolution times, created proactive service delivery, new billable services |  
| 🧬 **Manufacturing Ops AI Tools** | OCR → AI classification → audit logs → insights for regulated environments |  
| 🧠 **RAG + ArangoDB Stack** | Vector search + embeddings for enterprise-scale semantic knowledge retrieval |  
| 🎥 **SCENE** | Whisper + multimodal video intelligence → segmentation, summaries, story arcs |  
| 🎨 **Multimodal Campaign Analyzer** | Combines layout, copy, and imagery to predict donor behavior |  

Every system shares one core DNA: **built for operators, designed to last, and aligned with real-world constraints.**

## 📊 Impact
- **Throughput** → Automated pipelines that shave hours/days off manual processes.  
- **Compliance** → Structured data ready for audits and regulated workflows.  
- **Resilience** → Systems designed with ops discipline: monitoring, scaling, and accountability.  
- **Adoption** → Coaching teams to move from spreadsheets → modern AI/analytics tools without losing trust.

## 👥 The Team (That’s Me + You)
- **My Role**: Engineer + operator → building tools that scale and survive in production.  
- **Your Role**: Domain experts who know the business pain points.  
- **Together**: We accelerate adoption, cut inefficiency, and transform experiments into enterprise-ready AI.

## 🧘 Final Word
AI isn’t magic.  
It’s **math + context — and context is always human.**

I don’t build hype.  
I build **Iron Man suits for operators.**
