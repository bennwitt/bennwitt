## 👋 Hi, I’m Benn  
An idealistic pragmatist with a passion for building demos, tools, and systems that scale people — not just software.

I’ve led productized AI systems from napkin sketch to general availability, built demo-like tools that explain the value of complex tech in seconds, and enabled teams with the documentation, content, and confidence to use them.

I live at the intersection of:

- 🤖 **AI Engineering** – from whisper-based content summarizers to custom RAG systems
- 🧰 **Product Architecture** – full stack: backend, API, data, UX
- 🎬 **Demo & Enablement** – I create tools and content that teach while they demo
- ⚡ **Velocity** – MVPs in days, not quarters

---

## 🔍 What I Do Well (Especially for a Demo Architect Role)

- 🛠️ **Design & Build Demo Environments**  
  I’ve created interactive tools like **CopyThat**, **SCENE**, and **MUSE**, acting as live demos of our strategic AI capabilities. They’re self-guided, personalized, and outcome-driven — everything a good demo should be.

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Productivity**  
  Built systems that automate transcription, summarization, sentiment detection, and metadata extraction. I lean into LLMs and self-hosted OSS models to multiply human capability — and demo it in action.

- 🧩 **Custom Tailored Use Cases**  
  Tools like MUSE and vidCap were scoped, built, and pitched around real user stories — similar to building a proof-of-concept demo for a key customer segment.

- 🗂️ **Create Demo Scripts & Guides**  
  Every product I’ve built shipped with human-centered onboarding: demo scripts, walkthroughs, and internal enablement docs. I believe a tool isn’t “done” until it’s teachable.

- 🎥 **Record & Present Demos**  
  I’ve created recorded explainers and internal walkthroughs for technical and non-technical teams. It’s not just about the build — it’s about the clarity.
