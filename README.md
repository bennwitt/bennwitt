## 🎤 The Pitch
I am Benn — a **solutions engineer and pragmatic idealist** with a career spanning **IT service delivery, enterprise operations, and AI engineering.**  
My foundation was built in escalation engineering for hardware, software, SaaS, and PaaS, where I developed a discipline for designing resilient, accountable systems that kept global services running.  

In the past five years, I have extended this foundation with **AI-driven solutions** — using machine learning and automation to reduce inefficiency, improve clarity, and scale services and delivery.  

I specialize in translating between **AI capability and operational need**, delivering solutions that align with real-world constraints while creating measurable business value.

## 🩹 The Problem
Across industries — marketing and advertising, manufacturing, logistics, IT operations, service delivery, creative production, and events managment — organizations face a consistent set of challenges:  

- **Volume and complexity of data**: telemetry, logs, and documents that are difficult to parse into insight.  
- **Operational inefficiency**: manual workflows, redundant processes, and siloed systems that limit throughput.  
- **High-stakes visibility**: regulated production lines, client-facing platforms, and live event broadcasts where transparency and precision are non-negotiable.  
- **Skills gap in emerging technologies**: teams benefit from upskilling in AI, machine learning, and pattern recognition, but practical adoption remains slow.  

The problem is not a lack of tools or dashboards. It is the **translation gap** between overwhelming data streams and the clarity required for resilient, transparent, and trusted decision-making.

## 💡 The Solution  

I build **human-centered AI systems** that blend my service delivery and operations background with modern AI.  
My focus is not on hype, but on **practical tools** that integrate seamlessly into real workflows:  

- **Document & Language Intelligence** → Transforming messy inputs (scanned docs, creative copy, campaign assets) into structured insights with tools like **MUSE** and **CopyThat**.  
- **Predictive Monitoring** → Surfacing drift and anomalies from logs, metrics, and telemetry through systems like **HOLA** (Holistic Log Analyzer) and **MMS** (monitoring service for encoders, servers, and worker queues).  
- **Operational RAG** → Embedding-aware semantic search and knowledge retrieval that scales across complex environments.  
- **Multimodal Analyzers** → Linking image, text, and layout into meaningful outcomes, from creative performance signals to scientific or operational insight.  
- **Video Intelligence** → Using systems like **SCENE** to transcribe, segment, and analyze long-form content for structure, summaries, and story arcs.  

In short: I design AI to **fit into enterprise contexts**, not fight against them — so it runs alongside existing systems, workflows, and human judgment.

## 📈 Traction & Proof  

My work spans **enterprise IT operations** and **AI innovation**, always with the same goal:  
make complex systems **usable, reliable, and valuable**.  

| 🚧 Project | 🛠️ What It Does |  
|------------|-----------------|  
| 🔧 **Enterprise Ops Systems** | Built diagnostic & monitoring platforms that reduced resolution times, enabled proactive service delivery, and created new value streams |  
| 📊 **HOLA** | Centralized log analysis with ELK → surfacing anomalies across distributed systems |  
| 🖥️ **MMS** | Monitoring service for encoders, servers, and worker farm queues → stability in high-visibility environments |  
| 🧬 **MUSE** | AI-driven creative asset evaluator → analyzes tone, composition, and performance impact |  
| ✍️ **CopyThat** | AI-powered copywriting & analysis platform → generates, scores, and iterates persuasive content |  
| 🧠 **RAG + ArangoDB Stack** | Embedding-aware semantic search for enterprise-scale knowledge retrieval |  
| 🎥 **SCENE** | Multimodal video intelligence: transcription, segmentation, summarization, and insights |  
| 🎨 **Multimodal Campaign Analyzer** | Correlates layout, imagery, and copy with audience behavior patterns |  

Every project, whether operational or creative, shares one DNA:  
**built for operators, designed to last, and grounded in the realities of service delivery.**

## 📊 Impact  

- **Throughput** → Automated pipelines that save hours/days of manual effort.  
- **Clarity** → Turning logs, telemetry, and unstructured content into usable insight.  
- **Resilience** → Systems designed with ops discipline: monitored, tested, and production-ready.  
- **Adoption** → Helping teams move from fragmented workflows (spreadsheets, manual logs, siloed tools) to integrated, modern AI/analytics solutions.  
- **Trust** → Always human-centered: AI augments decision-making, but people remain in control.
