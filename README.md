## 🎤 The Pitch
I am Benn — a **solutions engineer and pragmatic idealist** with a career spanning **IT service delivery, enterprise operations, and AI engineering.**  
My foundation was built in escalation engineering for hardware, software, SaaS, and PaaS, where I developed a discipline for designing resilient, accountable systems that kept global services running.  

In the past five years, I have extended this foundation with **AI-driven solutions** — using machine learning and automation to reduce inefficiency, improve clarity, and scale services and delivery.  

I specialize in translating between **AI capability and operational need**, delivering solutions that align with real-world constraints while creating measurable business value.

## 🩹 The Problem
Across industries — manufacturing, logistics, IT operations, service delivery, creative production, and live events — organizations face a consistent set of challenges:  

- **Volume and complexity of data**: telemetry, logs, and documents that are difficult to parse into insight.  
- **Operational inefficiency**: manual workflows, redundant processes, and siloed systems that limit throughput.  
- **High-stakes visibility**: regulated production lines, client-facing platforms, and live broadcasts where transparency and precision are non-negotiable.  
- **Skills gap in emerging technologies**: teams benefit from upskilling in AI, machine learning, and pattern recognition, but practical adoption remains slow.  

The problem is not a lack of tools or dashboards. It is the **translation gap** between overwhelming data streams and the clarity required for resilient, transparent, and trusted decision-making.
