## 🎤 The Pitch
I’m Benn, an **AI Engineer and pragmatic builder** who designs **AI systems that amplify people rather than replace them.**  

Think of me as the **translator between AI capabilities and real-world operations** — turning complexity into clarity, chaos into context, and experiments into production-grade systems.  

But before I was building custom RAG stacks and multimodal analyzers, I spent years in **IT operations and service delivery**, running enterprise platforms where uptime, stability, and scalability weren’t optional — they were the mission. That background means I design AI with the same mindset: **resilient, accountable, and ready for production.**

> 🧘 “I don’t replace the operator — I give them the Iron Man suit. 鉄人”

## 🩹 The Problem
Modern operations — whether in manufacturing, logistics, or creative workflows — face:  
- **Data overload**: scanned records, instrument logs, and compliance docs that resist easy analysis.  
- **Inefficiency**: manual workflows that slow throughput and introduce risk.  
- **High stakes**: regulated environments where errors mean cost, delay, or compliance risk.  

Teams need more than dashboards — they need **AI that integrates into their systems, augments their decisions, and scales with their reality.**

## 👥 The Team (That’s Me + You)
- **My Role**: Engineer + operator → building tools that scale and survive in production.  
- **Your Role**: Domain experts who know the business pain points.  
- **Together**: We accelerate adoption, cut inefficiency, and transform experiments into enterprise-ready AI.

## 🧘 Final Word
AI isn’t magic.  
It’s **math + context — and context is always human.**

I don’t build hype.  
I build **Iron Man suits for operators.**
